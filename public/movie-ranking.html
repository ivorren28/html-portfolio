<h3>John wick</h3>
<p> Wick is a legendary hitman who is 
    reluctantly drawn back into the criminal 
    underworld after retiring.</p>
<h4>Extraction</h4>
<p>The extraction genre is all about 
    engaging in a high-stakes environment where the goal 
    is not just survival, but the pursuit of acquiring 
    and extracting valuable loot, all while balancing 
    the risk of potentially losing it all</p>
<h5>Equalizer</h5>
<p> A former special service commando 
    who faked his own death in hopes of living out a quiet life. 
    Instead, he comes out of his self-imposed retirement 
    to save a young girl, and finds his desire for 
    justice reawakened after coming face-to-face 
    with members of a brutal Russian gang.</p>
